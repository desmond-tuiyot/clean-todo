### Things Todo App
A simple todo web app made using `Flask`. Project idea credit to a post in [Bits and Pieces](https://blog.bitsrc.io/15-app-ideas-to-build-and-level-up-your-coding-skills-28612c72a3b1)
by Florin Pop - see his github repo of project ideas [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas)  
I will use the user stories and bonus features suggested there first, then add more features as 
inspiration strikes or as the need arises.
